Two tasks for Open Broker.
See decription for each task in folders.

I didn't use scss for first task and es6 for second task cause they aren't big. 

Task 1 -- Form with post request. I did it with fetch, cause it es6-feature and it is more comfortable to use then XMLHttpRequest. It also native for modern browsers now.

Task 2 -- Gallery. It works even without JS. I think i can add Service Worker for lost connection in future. Also I can refactor this code later.
